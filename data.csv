"Alge, Bradley",algeb@purdue.edu,"Eyes On': Body-worn Cameras, Visibility and Police Officer Emotional Labor",Daniels College of Business,Organizational Behavior/Human Resources,"Organizational behavior, Psychology, Human resource management, Analytics","The concept of visibility has a long tradition in psychology. The 'looking glass self' (Cooley, 1902), 'on-stage self' versus 'off-stage self' (Goffman, 1959), social facilitation theory (Zajonc, 1965), laissez-faire leadership (Hu et al., 2022), and social presence theory (Short et al.,1976) all suggest that the presence or absence of eyes on, or near, a focal actor can affect the actor's attitudes and behaviors, both in physical (Guerin, 1986) and electronic presence (Aiello & Douthitt, 2002). The concept of personal visibility continues to evolve as technological advancements make surveillance more common (Zuboff, 2020).  There is a need to not only understand the effects of visibility, but to capture the boundary conditions and dimensions of visibility perceptions.
In the present study, we examine visibility through the lens of police officers. We define personal visibility as the perception of being seen or seeable by one or more others (including employees, supervisors, and general public) through one or more channels (physical proximity, digital proximity) in the conduct of one's job duties. Police officers' face a national undercurrent of heightened public scrutiny of the profession ¦these things added to the ordinary hassles of the workplace and their personal lives can lead to cumulative stress and burnout (Spence et al., 2019). Many police departments operate under command-and-control systems characterized by high supervision, ostensibly to keep a 'close eye' on employees.  Moreover, the introduction of police body-worn camera (BWCs) technology allows for the possibility of 'always on' recording of police officer activity. In 2018, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that 80% of large police organizations and 47% of all law enforcement organizations had adopted BWCs. High vigilance, long hours under surveillance, and frequent interactions with public, in an environment of intense media/societal scrutiny' creates a near perfect storm of an 'always on' mentality, which can exacerbate burnout.

When examining BWC technology in policing, studies typically focus on outcomes such as whether BWC usage and the transparency it affords can reduce use of force, deter police misbehavior, and encourage citizen cooperation.  Adams and Mastracci (2019) note, â€œWhile some recent studies explore officer attitudes toward BWCs, none examine the effect of wearing BWCs on officers themselves (p. 6) suggesting more research is needed on how BWC affects individual officers.
To date, we are unaware of any study that has examined BWC usage and its effects on emotional labor (EL), nor have we found research examining 'visibility' derived from different sources and technology. To fill this gap, we conceptualize personal visibility as a multi-sourced belief and plan to test our model by examining use of BWC in law enforcement organizations across the United States, using methods including, but not limited to surveys, focus groups, and archival data collection.

We build upon recent advances in EL research focusing less on contexts where EL is a strategy for monetary gain in customer service environments, to examining contexts, including coworker and public interactions, where emotional regulation is without direct monetary incentive (Gabriel et al., 2020).","Anyone interested in learning about people in organizations such as organizational culture, managing change, leadership, motivation, individual differences, and team dynamics","please send your statement of interest (list skills you have or wish to develop, and include the reason why this project is a good fit for you), to Dr. Bradley Alge, algeb@purdue.edu.

"Ambike, Satyajit",sambike@purdue.edu,Maneuverability in human movements across the age span,College of Health and Human Sciences,Department of Health and Kinesiology,"Biomechanics, Human motor control, Dynamical systems, Human locomotion, Prehension, Aging and movement, Stability of movement","​We study how humans plan and execute changes in movements. While stabilizing movement is important while moving in a consistent way in a fairly unchanging environment (e.g., walking in a straight line over flat ground), altering stability to facilitate maneuvers is arguably more important to accomplish functional goals in the real ever-changing world.

We study the stability-modulation strategies that humans -  from young adults to octogenarians - employ to maneuver.
There are two projects: one studies walking, and the other studies object manipulation. Both behaviors are critical to maintaining the quality of life (especially in older adults), and maneuverability in both is poorly understood. Students will assist and learn to use motion capture systems (Vicon) and force plates to acquire movement data from human participants. Students can also learn about biomechanical data analysis and analyzing large data sets.","All majors are welcome. Students who have a particular interest in physics, biology, biomedical engineering, and mechanical engineering are preferred.

"Bassoe, Pedro",pbassoe@purdue.edu,"Japanese Illustration and Book Design, 19th and 20th Centuries*",College of Liberal Arts,School of Languages and Cultures,"Art history, Print culture, Literature, Woodblock printing, Illustration, Book art","The quality and sophistication of book art produced in Japan in the 19th and 20th centuries are unparalleled in global print traditions. Japanese publishers began printing popular picture books known as gōkan (“collected volumes”) in the early 19th century, which were produced in print runs numbering in the thousands to over ten thousand copies each and were consumed throughout Japan by educated men, women, and children. This traditional art form died out in the late 19th century, but new varieties of illustrated book art began to proliferate as woodblock printing was joined by new print technologies such as typeset printing, lithography, and photography. From the early 19th century to the mid-20th century, Japanese books featured dazzling images of samurai, geisha, sages, sorceresses, monsters, ghosts, traditional culture, and abstract designs, much of which resonates with today’s popular visual culture from Japan.

This project is related to Dr. Bassoe’s current research project and book-in-progress, in which he describes the use of illustration and book design in the literature of modern author Izumi Kyōka (1873-1939). For this project, Dr. Bassoe will work with a group of 2 - 3 undergraduate researchers to this project, identify, purchase, catalog, and eventually exhibit a collection of illustrated Japanese books and book art. Students will be introduced to the archives and materials relevant to the project and will assist in identifying, purchasing, and securing the shipping of such items. Once acquired, we would begin the process of analyzing these materials as a group and creating a catalog or database in which we would describe the physical, visual, and literary properties of the items that we have acquired. Ideally, this process would continue the following year, with the goal of planning an exhibition for fall of 2024 or spring of 2025.","Knowledge of Japanese is highly desirable. At least one student participant in the project must have a solid knowledge of written Japanese. Applicants need to have knowledge of art forms including woodblock printing, book art, or familiarity with print culture, and experience with art historical projects, cataloging, and exhibiting artwork.
Students majoring in Japanese, Art History, Printmaking, Art and Design, Visual Communication Design, Studio Arts, and Technology are preferred.","please fill out the Qualtrics survey to indicate your interest. A copy of your CV and a statement of interest, including a description of knowledge of Japanese, print culture, and/or planning art exhibitions, are required for your application. "
"Bejarano, Andres",abejara@purdue.edu,Automatic Analysis of Algorithm Runtimes,College of Science,Department of Computer Science,"Software development, Computer science education","Algorithm analysis is a crucial skill every Computer Scientist, Computer Engineer, or Software Developer must know how to perform. Traditionally, it is covered during core undergraduate courses on a theoretical basis. In such courses, students are asked to solve programming projects having runtime requirements as part of the problem description. Unfortunately, estimating the actual runtime of a solution (i.e., the difference between the end time and the start time of the program) is sensitive to the additional processes running on a system. So, runtime evaluation reduces to impose limits on the amount of time each program must take to return an answer. This project considers an automatic runtime analysis based on the traditional approach: counting the number of times an algorithm runs an operation or the number of iterations it must take to return an answer. To accomplish such a goal, a code parser introduces new counting variables to a source code to count iterations or executions. Then, it runs the new code using the defined testing cases. Finally, the script collects the counted values and runs curve-fitting regression to find the best traditional runtime descriptor (i.e., terms used to describe orders of growth). We will evaluate the accuracy of the solution by running the analyzer on multiple programming project solutions submitted by students. The scope of this solution has applications in Computer Science and Programming Education, Source Code Optimization, and good practices in Software Development. The results of this project will be of immediate application in the upcoming offerings of CS251- Data Structures and Algorithms.","Applicants need to have knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms, Algorithm Analysis, Compilers, Software Engineering, Numerical Methods, and Statistics. Students majoring in CS, ECE, CGT are preferred. ","For more information and to apply, please contact Dr. Bejarano.

"Bermel, Peter",Pbermel@purdue.edu,Radiation-hardened microelectronics,College of Engineering,Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering,"Fields and optics, Microelectronics, Nanotechnology","Project 1: Space radiation environment modeling (Prof. Bermel)- Outer space is known as a harsh environment, but not all regions in space are the same. For example, low earth satellite orbits benefit from charged particles being deflected by the Van Allen belts. In this project, we’ll focus on collecting data on the raw number of ionizing radiation particles associated with different space orbits, and then converting those values into aggregate measures such as total ionizing dose and single event effect rates, to help predict the lifetime of existing devices in these orbits.
Project 2: Radiation-effects testing (Prof. Bermel) - Commercial off-the-shelf electronics are appealing for satellite applications because of their high capabilities (e.g., processing speed or memory). While they are generally tested for reliability for terrestrial applications, most manufacturers don’t have time to test or qualify them for space applications. In this project, we’ll select a novel commercial device to test, and develop a test procedure for testing. Last summer, our methodology was applied to a commercial magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) device, using a Gammacell chamber on campus. We will have the option to either extend that previous work or test a novel commercial device that has not been tested before.

Project 3: Hybrid radiation shielding design (Prof. Bermel and Garner) - since there are multiple types of radiation in space environments, it is important to shield against these different sources. However, different materials have different levels of shielding against different radiation sources. In this project, we will devise a hybrid shielding material to protect against multiple sources of radiation (e.g., neutrons and protons).","Look for undergraduate researchers majoring in Engineering, preferably Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nuclear Engineering or have a strong interest in radiation-tolerant microelectronics. Applicants need to be familiar with electromagnetism.","please send a copy of your CV/Resume and transcript to Dr. Bermel, pbermel@purdue.edu."
"Bosman, Lisa",lbosman@purdue.edu,Using Qualitative Thematic Analysis to Understand Engineering Professor Perceptions for Implementing New Entrepreneurially Minded Curriculum,Purdue Polytechnic Institute,Technology Leadership and Innovation,Engineering education research,"The Entrepreneurship for All movement has many universities and communities offering campus-wide initiatives in the form of new centers, degrees, minors, courses, accelerator programs, and student organizations. Many engineering faculty are becoming involved in teaching entrepreneurial thinking due to the connection between engineering design and opportunity recognition, often associated with entrepreneurship. Moreover, the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) has made significant investments in helping engineering educators develop and assess entrepreneurially-minded curricula. However, dissemination and sharing practices have yet to be fully optimized across engineering faculty and their institutions.

The dissemination of best teaching practices can be done through a variety of formats. Yet, within the academic setting, journal manuscripts and conference proceedings are the most well-documented approaches to provide evidence of teaching and research excellence for faculty promotion and tenure (P&T) portfolio documents. Engineering faculty with more formal technical or disciplinary training might find it more efficient to document best teaching practices through the scholarship of teaching and learning (SOTL). SOTL investigates student learning and satisfaction based on innovative teaching interventions with the purpose of sharing best practices and lessons learned from an educator's perspective.

The overarching goal of this project is to showcase the findings from a cohort-based engineering faculty professional development experience which has two key components: curriculum development and SOTL dissemination. This professional development experience was offered virtually, thus, increasing access to engineering faculty at colleges across the U.S., both within and outside the KEEN network.

For the curriculum development, faculty participants completed training on how bio-inspired design and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) can be coupled with the entrepreneurial mindset to broaden engineering participation using a transdisciplinary, humanistic approach. Part of the training included implementing the new curriculum in the engineering classroom and assessing student learning to better understand student perceptions of the new curriculum. The focus on bio-inspired design, STEAM, and the entrepreneurial mindset was intentional for the following reasons. First, developing aspiring engineers' entrepreneurial mindsets encourages students to seek the 'sweet spot' between customer viability, technological feasibility, and business viability, ideally creating a valuable design with high innovation and impact. Second, bio-inspired design is the development of technologies to improve the environment or human's quality of life, which can create a relevant and engaging learning space. It allows engineering instructors and engineering students, alike, the opportunity to explore how holistic assets can support innovation. The focus on bio-inspired design is intentional as it has immediate connections to nature- and human-centered design, applicable to most (if not all) engineering disciplines. Third, the integration of STEAM with a particular emphasis on the arts encourages transdisciplinary problem-solving. In addition, the use of STEAM promotes connections across a variety of technical and humanities-focused disciplines, bringing together a diversity of perspectives, frameworks, and paradigms. As a result, applying STEAM together with bio-inspired design and the entrepreneurial mindset has the capacity to broaden participation among persons traditionally underrepresented in STEM, including women and minoritized populations.

For the SOTL dissemination, faculty participants completed training on how to write-up and disseminate SOTL research. Part of the training required participants to use the assessment data collected from the newly developed and implemented curriculum to draft an ASEE conference proceeding. Participants worked in small virtual writing groups (VWG) to develop and receive feedback on a manuscript interpreting and showcasing student assessment of learning.

This project will demonstrate how KEEN's priorities of teaching entrepreneurially-minded curriculum can be aligned with the promotion and tenure (P&T) processes common at most higher education institutions. Simply put, this professional development experience offers another value proposition for engineering educators to leverage involvement in entrepreneurship education through an activity and a potential paper related to best teaching practices on their P&T portfolio documents.","include dedicating about 3-5 hours per week on the project, the ability to do independent work, and good time management skills.
